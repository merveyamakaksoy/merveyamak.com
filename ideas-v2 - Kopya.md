# Design Approach for Landscape Architect Portfolio - Merve Yamak Aksoy

## Selected Design: Minimalist Modern with Pastel Palette

**Design Philosophy**: Contemporary minimalism meets nature-inspired warmth through soft, accessible pastel colors and clean geometric layouts.

**Core Principles**:
- Minimalist, uncluttered layouts with strategic use of whitespace
- Pastel color palette that feels fresh, approachable, and modern
- Nature-inspired design elements that complement landscape architecture work
- Clean typography and geometric shapes for contemporary feel

**Color Palette**:
- Soft sage green (#C8DCC8) - primary accent, represents nature
- Soft blush pink (#F5E6E1) - secondary accent, warmth
- Powder blue (#E8F1F5) - tertiary accent, freshness
- Cream white (#FAFAF8) - background, clean and minimal
- Charcoal (#3A3A3A) - text, strong contrast
- Soft peach (#F5DCC8) - highlights and accents

**Typography**:
- Display: Poppins (600-700 weight) - modern, geometric, clean
- Body: Inter (400-500 weight) - minimalist, highly readable
- Accent: Playfair Display (400-600) - elegant, for project titles

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Grid-based but with asymmetric arrangements
- Generous whitespace between sections
- Cards and modular components for projects
- Clean dividers and subtle separators

**Signature Elements**:
- Soft, rounded corners (12-16px) for modern feel
- Subtle shadows and depth
- Nature-inspired illustrations or icons
- Project cards with hover effects
- Minimalist award badges

**Animation**:
- Smooth, subtle transitions (400-600ms)
- Gentle fade-in on scroll
- Hover effects with soft scale and shadow
- No excessive motion - keeps focus on content

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Clean, intuitive navigation
- Project cards that expand or reveal details
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Clear call-to-action buttons
